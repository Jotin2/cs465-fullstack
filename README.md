CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

# Architecture
The frontend devlopment used in this project includes Express HTML, Javascript, and single-page application(SPA). Using Express HTML involves generating and serving HTML templates on the server, while JavaScript serves to enhance interactivity in both SPAs. SPAs provide a dynamic and responsive user experience by loading once and updating content on a single page, thanks to JavaScript's central role in handling frontend logic and API communication. 

# Functionality
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) distinguishes itself from JavaScript as a data interchange format, while JavaScript is a programming language. JSON acts as a bridge between frontend and backend development by providing a standardized way to structure and transmit data, allowing seamless communication between the two layers. It enables frontend applications to request and receive data from backend APIs in a universally understood format, facilitating interoperability and efficient data exchange between the user interface and the server.

# Testing
In a full stack application, methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are employed for requesting and retrieving data from specific API endpoints, each serving as a unique URL route that corresponds to a specific functionality or resource. These endpoints act as gateways for data interaction between the frontend and backend. Testing these endpoints involves verifying their behavior using tools like Postman, ensuring proper data retrieval and manipulation. Moreover, security layers, such as authentication and authorization mechanisms, add complexity to API testing, requiring verification of secure data transmission and access control. Understanding and effectively testing these methods, endpoints, and security measures are essential for ensuring the integrity, reliability, and protection of data in a full stack application.

# Reflection
This course has significantly advanced my journey toward becoming a software engineer. I've gained a solid foundation in setting up and integrating key technologies like Node.js, Express, Angular, and MongoDB, enabling me to confidently initiate and manage full stack projects. I've learned to create robust backend systems by implementing routes and controllers, and I've developed the ability to design secure user authentication mechanisms, a crucial aspect of modern software development. Additionally, acquiring the skill to generate and manage components within Angular has empowered me to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
